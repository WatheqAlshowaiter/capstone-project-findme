# Findme
Our website is a service that connects lost people with anyone who is looking for them. We have two scenarios on our website of loss, the first type is a lost person and the other type is people who are found but missing their relatives or anyone that takes care of them.\
In the first scenario when someone is lost, his/her relatives will search for him/her. If they found him/her they will contact the person who posts. If not somebody will post pieces of information about the lost person with his/her way of contact. After the lost person is found (hopefully) using our service, anyone who posts the lost person will update the case to be successfully found.\
The other scenario is finding somebody missing his/her relatives or whoever takes care of him/her. If he/she does not found in the search, someone will post about this person with his/her way of contact. then the operation is the same as the first scenario.
Our website can be used by any user with all functionalities except posting or editing posts. This functionality requires a login and we are using Google authentication. We want our website to be as simple and efficient as possible to find lost people without any barriers from any kind of user with the minimum technical skills.
